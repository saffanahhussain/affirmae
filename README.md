## General Info
This project simply allows users to creatively adapt their health and wellbeing into a tracker-like format. It adapts their fitness, and cycles affirmations through to their emails.
I wanted individuals to be able to minimise the apps within their mobile devices that are allocated to their body (mentally & physically). 

## Technologies Used
Project is created with: 
Python - 3.10
